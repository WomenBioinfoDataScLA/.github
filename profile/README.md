# Welcome to our **WBDS LA**'s GitHub Organization 👋

🙋‍♀️ What is our organization all about?
**[Women in Bioinformatics and Data Science LA](https://wbds.la)** is a non-profit organization of women working in the fields of Bioinformatics and Data Science created in 2019 aiming at promoting and making visible the research carried out by women in these fields. We also seek to create networking and collaboration within the community of women scientists from both the public and private sectors. Our projects aim to bring together researchers from Latin America who work in the areas of systems biology, omics technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, data mining and high-performance computing with applications in biology from the public and private sectors.
